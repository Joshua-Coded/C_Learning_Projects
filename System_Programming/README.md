# System Programming

This folder contains projects related to system-level programming in C, such as process management, inter-process communication (IPC), and system calls. These exercises will help you understand how C interacts with the operating system at a low level.

### Projects:
- Simple Shell Implementation
- Process Management (fork, exec, wait)
- Scheduling Simulation

These projects will enhance your ability to write efficient system-level code and prepare for Linux kernel development.
