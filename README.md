# C Learning Projects

### Author: **Joshua Alana**

Welcome to my **C Learning Projects** repository! This collection of projects and exercises is part of my extended journey to master C programming and system-level concepts, ultimately preparing me for Linux kernel development. Over the next 6-8 months, I will be working on various projects covering a wide range of topics in C, including memory management, system calls, process control, data structures, and kernel modules.

During this period, I will also be actively seeking **internship opportunities in big tech companies** to gain practical experience and apply my growing skills in real-world scenarios.

---

## **Project Breakdown**

### 1. **Data Structures**
   - Implementations of core data structures such as:
     - Linked Lists
     - Binary Trees
     - Hash Tables
     - Heaps
   - These implementations focus on efficient memory use and pointer management in C.

### 2. **System Programming**
   - Projects that explore:
     - Process management using `fork`, `exec`, `wait`
     - Inter-process communication (IPC) via pipes and message queues
     - A simple command-line shell that supports I/O redirection and process piping.

### 3. **Memory Management**
   - Custom implementations of memory management functions:
     - `malloc` and `free`
     - Paging and virtual memory simulations
   - Projects that simulate memory allocation for dynamic data structures and applications.

### 4. **Kernel Projects**
   - Exploring the Linux kernel:
     - Writing and loading kernel modules (e.g., "Hello World" module)
     - Custom system calls
     - Kernel-level memory management and process control.
