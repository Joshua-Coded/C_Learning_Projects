# Memory Management

This folder contains custom implementations of memory management functions such as `malloc` and `free`, as well as projects focused on virtual memory and paging. Understanding memory allocation and management is crucial for low-level programming and kernel work.

### Implementations:
- Custom malloc and free
- Memory allocator simulation

These projects will improve your understanding of memory management in C and prepare you for more advanced topics like kernel memory handling.
