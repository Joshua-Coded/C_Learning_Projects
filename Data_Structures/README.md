# Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of fundamental data structures in C. These structures focus on efficient memory use and pointer management, which are essential skills for low-level programming and kernel development.

### Implementations:
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

Each implementation is designed to help build a strong foundation in memory management and algorithmic efficiency in C.
